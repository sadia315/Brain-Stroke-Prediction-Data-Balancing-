# Brain-Stroke-Prediction-Data-Balancing-
Comparative Study on Brainstroke Prediction Using Data Balancing Techniques
Overview
This project presents a comprehensive study on predicting brainstroke occurrences by employing various data balancing techniques. The aim is to enhance the performance of machine learning models when dealing with imbalanced datasets, which is a common issue in medical datasets. By comparing different balancing techniques, we strive to identify the most effective method for improving prediction accuracy.
