# Brain-Stroke-Prediction-Data-Balancing-
Comparative Study on Brainstroke Prediction Using Data Balancing Techniques

Abstractâ€”
Brain stroke is a medical malady that happens when there is a blockage in the blood circulation in the brain or when a blood vessel in the brain breaks and leaks. The global prevalence of the disease is gradually growing. Recent study shows that early detection of stroke is the most critical factor in improving patient care and treatment outcomes. Timely prediction of brain stroke is crucial for implementing preventive measures and improving patient outcomes. Although machine learning algorithms are used for automatic diagnosis. However, they have certain limits in terms of accuracy. Another issue is that models trained on class-unbalanced datasets often have poor results. Therefore, the main objective of the proposed work is to include a pre-processing method for balancing the data before the machine learning algorithms to improve classification accuracy. we present a comprehensive comparative study on the application of data balancing techniques like SMOTE, ADASYN and hybrid technique like SMOTE+TOMEK links  to enhance the performance of brain stroke prediction models. Our proposed methodologies outperform other arts-of-methods in terms of accuracy specificity, sensitivity, and other characteristics.
